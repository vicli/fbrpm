		<ul>
			<li>I'm a software engineer by trade, but a lot of my work @Fitbit involves understanding
			consumer use cases and prioritizing work that optimizes user satisfaction. This means working with product to understand the real impact of our work, either through KPIs or other metrics.</li>
			<br/>

			<li>I'm curious about everything and love broadening my scope of knowledge, which sometimes leads to unhealthy obsessions (currently it's deep sea creatures).</li>
			<br/>

			<li>I care about team dynamics, and understand the importance of safe collaboration. I like to think of my communication style as 'softly outspoken' -- I will provide my opinions with my reasoning, but I will also be extremely receptive to others.  </li>
			<br/>

			<li>I'm a risk taker, inside and outside of work. I'll always take the initiative to improve a process, or to try something new, and use the success (or failure) as a lesson.</li>

			I believe that current software solutions are just the tip of the iceberg. 
			<br/>
			<br/>

			We can do (and are doing) so much more -- tackling bigger questions like global connectivity, healthcare improvements, and operations optimizations, while also providing impactful services in our day to day lives. 
			<br/>
			<br/>

			Facebook has an unprecedented touch on the <i>pulse of the entire world</i>. With 1.7 billion active monthly users, the numbers are staggering, and with that comes the huge potential to impact the world for the better. Whether that is refining the messenger app, bringing attention to world issues, or something even grander, it is undeniable that being at Facebook will give incredible weight to the work that I do. 
			<br/>
			<br/>

			Working for a company like Facebook would be challenging, but incredibly inspiring. I would be learning from the best to do my best, and that is an opportunity that I would <b>love</b> to have.
